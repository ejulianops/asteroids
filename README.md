It's a guided project to clone the classic Asteroids game using Pygame.

**Game overview:**

In Asteroids you have to survive flying through an asteroid belt, dodging and shooting rocks that come at you from all directions. By [Atari](https://atari.com/products/asteroids-limited-edition?_pos=10&_sid=dbf03d409&_ss=r).

**Learning, practicing outcomes:**

- Pygame display.set_mode;
- Pygame event;
- Pygame fill;
- Pygame display.flip;
- game loop;
- handle user input;
- manage game state;
- object-oriented programming concepts to create game objects and manage their interactions.

**Installing:**
- Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer. Check your version running `python3 --version`;
- Install Pygame. Run `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`. Check [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for further instructions.
- Download the files to your machine. Click on the green button Code, copy the repo URL, go to the folder you want to work on your machine and run `git clone url` where url is the link you copied from the green button.
- In your machine, go to the project folder running `cd asteroids`.
- Run the program with `python3 main.py`.
